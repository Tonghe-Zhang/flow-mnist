Authorship:
The files under ./cfm:, which are definition for some neural nets are borrowed from https://github.com/atong01/conditional-flow-matching. 

The rest of the documents, including the whole training and evaluation pipeline, are written from scatch by Tonghe. 

The log and eval directories are removed to save space.
